            <h3>Software Developer Intern</h3>
            <p>
                During my internship at VOXAI, I gained hands-on experience in monitoring and optimizing critical applications responsible for handling mobile/phone services for high-profile clients, including American Airlines. My key responsibilities included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Monitoring and Uptime:</strong> Ensured seamless fulfillment of customer requests, achieving a 99.9% uptime and significantly enhancing customer satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Management:</strong> Managed and resolved over 150 monthly incidents using ServiceNow, including critical outages and performance issues, resulting in a 40% reduction in average resolution time.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis and Optimization:</strong> Utilized Oracle DB to track and analyze data on failed callbacks for key clients. Identified underlying patterns and implemented strategic solutions, reducing failed callbacks by over 50%.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Management and Log Analysis:</strong> Managed secure server access via PuTTY across 12+ servers, conducted comprehensive log analysis to troubleshoot and optimize Genesys-based contact center operations, improving system performance and reliability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This role honed my skills in incident management, data analysis, and system optimization, and demonstrated my ability to deliver reliable and efficient technical solutions in a fast-paced environment.
